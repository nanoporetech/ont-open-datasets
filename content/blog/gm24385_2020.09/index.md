We are happy to annouce the release of a Nanopore sequencing dataset
of the Genome in a Bottle sample GM24385.

Multiple PromethION flowcells using both the R9.4.1 and R10.3 nanopores.
The direct sequencer output is included, raw signal data stored in
.fast5 files and basecalled data in .fastq file. Additional secondary
analyses are included, notably alignments of sequence data to the
reference genome are provided along with statistics derived from these.

> The following cell lines/DNA samples were obtained from the NIGMS Human
Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research:
GM24385.
