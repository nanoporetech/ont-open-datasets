The ont-open-data registry provides reference sequencing data from Oxford
Nanopore Technologies to support,

1. Exploration of the characteristics of nanopore sequence data,
2. Assessment and reproduction of performance benchmarks,
3. Example datasets for analysis on EPI2ME, Oxford Nanopore Technologies' cloud
   compute infrastructure,
4. Development of tools and methods.

The data deposited showcases DNA sequences from a representative subset of
sequencing chemistries. The datasets correspond to publicly-available reference
samples (e.g. GM24385 as reference human). Raw data are provided with metadata
and scripts to describe sample and data provenance.
