***Running workflows using ONT's EPI2ME platform***

Oxford Nanopore's [EPI2ME](https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/)
platform includes several workflows for analysing
genomics datasets in the cloud with Amazon Web Services, reducing the
computational burden on the users local compute infrastructure.
For example, the [FASTQ Human Alignment GRCh38](https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/epi2me/v/mte_1014_v1_revba_11apr2016/human-alignment-grch38)
can be used to perform alignment of nanopore sequencing reads to 
the human reference genome to obtain industry standard BAM file outputs.
