The\nuploaded data contains the primary sequencer output data; the full MinKNOW\noutput directory for the runs is included verbatim. The release seperately\ncontains a directory structure resulting from the application of a snakemake\nanalysis pipeline. Here we provide details of how this workflow was executed\nand its outputs.</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nanoporetech/katuali\">Katuali</a> is a set of\n<a href=\"https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/\">Snakemake</a> analysis pipelines for basic\nanalysis of nanopore sequencing data. It can perform basic tasks such as\nbasecalling, alignment of reads, assembly, and evaluation and benchmarking of\nsuch algorithms. This can be performed at scale on large compute clusters on\nlocal or cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<p>For the GM24385 release Katuali was used to construct secondary analyses in a\ndocumented and reproducible fashion. As katuali is open source, it is possible\nfor users to reconstruct these secondary analyses for themselves from the\nprimary data. We have uploaded the results of these analysis to provide\nbenchmarking data and make available useful resources for others to perform\nfurther analysis.</p>\n<p>The Katuali pipeline used for the <a href=\"/ont-open-datasets/gm24385_2020.09\">GM24385 data release</a>\nprovides four main outputs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Align basecalls to reference sequence retaining all primary, secondary and\nsupplementary alignments are kept</li>\n<li>Filter .bam file to list of regions defined in configuration file retaining\nonly primary alignments.</li>\n<li>Produce read statistics from per-region .bams.</li>\n<li>Repack/group source .fast5 files according to primary alignment .bams to\nproduce per-region .fast5 file sets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These outputs provide added value to the primary data, and users can extend and\nadapt the katuali pipeline and configuration to calculate additional outputs.</p>\n<h3>Katuali configuration for GM24385 release</h3>\n<h3>Pipeline data flow</h3>\n<h3>Directory listing and description</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Katuali analysis pipeline for preparing human datasets","date":"September 22, 2020","description":"In this post we detail the open source analysis pipeline responsible for generating the GM24385 dataset."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/katuali_human_pipeline/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gm24385_2020.09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GM24385 Dataset Release"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","1462070832","2841359383"]}
